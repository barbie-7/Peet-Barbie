4Conditionals and Loops 
Control flow 
•The sequence of statements that are actually executed in a program. 
•Conditionals and loops  enable us to choreograph control flow. 
statement 1 
straight-line control flow statement 2 
statement 3 
statement 4    boolean 1 control flow with conditionals and a loop

control flow with conditionals and loops 

Conditionals 


6The if statement 
The if statement.   A common branching structure. 
•Evaluate a boolean  expression. 
•If True, execute a statement. 
•The else  option : If False , execute a different statement. 
if (boolean expression ):
   statement T 
else: 
   statement F 
can be any sequence 
of statements 
statement T true false boolean expression 
statement F

9 CASE 1: Ascending Order 
python3 order.py 8 9 
8 > 9 is false 

10 CASE 2: Descending Order 
python3 order.py 7 5 
7 > 5 is true

11 If Statement Examples 


12Example of if statement use: simulate a coin flip 
import stdrandom 
def main(): 
    if stdrandom.uniform() < 0.5: 
        stdio.writeln('Heads') 
    else: 
        stdio.writeln('Tails') 
if __name__ == '__main__': main() 
% python flip.py 
Heads 
% python flip.py 
Heads 
% python flip.py 
Tails 
% python flip.py 
Heads 
flip.py Take different action depending on value of variable.

3Example of if statement use 
def main(): 
    a = int(sys.argv[1]) 
    b = int(sys.argv[2]) 
    if (b < a): 
        t = a 
        a = b 
        b = t 
    stdio.writeln(a) 
    stdio.writeln(b) Q. What does this program do?

def main(): 
    a = int(sys.argv[1]) 
    b = int(sys.argv[2]) 
    summ = a + b 
    prod = a * b 
    stdio.writeln(str(a) + ' + ' + str(b) + ' = ' + str(summ) ) 
    stdio.writeln(str(a) + ' * ' + str(b) + ' = ' + str(prod) ) 
    if (b == 0): stdio.writeln('Division by zero'); 
    else:        stdio.writeln(str(a) + ' / ' + str(b) + ' = ' + str(a / b) ) 
    if (b == 0): stdio.writeln("Division by zero"); 
    else:        stdio.writeln(str(a) + ' % ' + str(b) + ' = ' + str(a % b) ) 
if __name__ == '__main__': main() % python intops.py 5 2 
5 + 2 = 7 
5 * 2 = 10 
5 / 2 = 2 
5 % 2 = 1 
% python IntOps.py 5 0 
5 + 0 = 5 
5 * 0 = 0

72Gambler's ruin problem 
A gambler starts with $ stake  and places $1 fair bets. 
•Outcome 1 (loss): Gambler goes broke with $0. 
•Outcome 2 (win): Gambler reaches $ goal.
One approach:  Monte Carlo simulation. 
•Use a simulated coin flip .
•Repeat and compute statistics. Q. What are the chances of winning? 
Q. How many bets until win or loss? 


73 Preamble 
Take different action depending on value of variable.  


74 Gambler's Ruin 


75 Digression:  Simulation and Analysis 
Fact. Probability of winning = stake ÷ goal. 
Fact. Expected number of bets = stake × desired gain. 
Ex.  20% chance of turning  $500 into $2500, 
but expect to make one million $1 bets. 
Remark.  Both facts can be proved mathematically; for more complex scenarios, computer 
simulation is often the best (only) plan of attack. % python3 gambler.py 5 25 1000 
191 wins of 1000 
% python3 gambler.py 5 25 1000 
203 wins of 1000 
% python3 gambler.py 500 2500 1000 
197 wins of 1000 stake goal T
after a substantial wait…. 
500/2500 = 20% 
500 * (2500 - 500) = 1 million

Debugging 
is 99% of program development in any programming language, even for experts. 
82Impossible ideal:  "Please compile, execute, and debug my program." 
Bottom line:  Programming is primarily a process of finding and fixing mistakes. “ As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get 
  programs right as we had thought.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large 
 part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. ” 
You will make many mistakes as you 
write programs.  It's normal. 
Bug: A mistake in a program. 
Why is this impossible? Stay tuned. EDIT 
COMPILE RUN Debugging: The process of eliminating bugs. 


Debugging 
is challenging because conditionals and loops dramatically increase  the number of possible outcomes. 
83Most programs contain numerous conditionals and loops, with nesting. program structure no loops n conditionals 1 loop 
number of possible execution 
sequences 1 2n
 no limit 
Good news.  Conditionals and loops provide structure that helps us understand our programs. 
“ The quality of programmers is a decreasing 
function of the number of goto statements in the 
programs they produce. ” 
− Edsgar Dijkstra 
Old and low-level languages have a goto 
statement that provides arbitrary structure. 
Eliminating gotos was controversial until 
Edsgar Dijkstra published the famous note 
"Goto considered harmful" in 1968. 

Debugging a program: a running example 
Problem:  Factor a large integer n.
Application:  Cryptography. 
84
import stdio 
import sys 
def main(): 
    n = int(sys.argv[1]) 
    
    i = 0 
    while i <= n: 
        while n % i == 0 
            # Cast out and write factor. 
            n //= i 
            stdio.write(str(i) + ' ') 
        i += 1 
if __name__ == '__main__': main() Method 
•Consider each integer i less than n
•While i divides n evenly 
     Print i  (it is a factor of n).
     Replace n with n/i .
Rationale: 
  1. Any factor of n/i is a factor of n.
  2. i may be a factor of n/i.Surprising fact: Security of internet commerce 
depends on difficulty of factoring large integers .3,757,208 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 13 × 13 × 397

Debugging a program: syntax errors 
Is your program a legal Python program? 
•Python compiler can help you find out. 
•Find the first compiler error (if any). 
•Repeat. 
•Result: An executable file

            # Cast out and write factor. 
            n //= i 
            stdio.write(str(i) + ' ')

Debugging a program: runtime and semantic errors 
Does your legal Python program do what you want it to do? 
•You need to run it to find out. 
•Find the first runtime error (if any). 
•Fix and repeat.

Debugging a program: testing 
Does your legal Python program always  do what you want it to do? 
•You need to test on many types of inputs it to find out. 
•Add trace code to find the first error. 
•Fix the error. 
•Repeat.

Program development in Python 
is a three-step process, with feedback 
1. EDIT your program 
•Create it by typing on your computer's keyboard. 
•Result: a text file such as factors.py .
2. COMPILE it to create an executable file 
•Use the Python compiler 
•Result: Python bytecode file 
•Mistake? Go back to 1. to fix and recompile. 
3. RUN your program 
•Use the Python interpreter. 
•Result: your program’s output. 
•Mistake? Go back to 1. to fix, recompile, and execute
