Why Programming ? 
Why programming?  Need to tell the computer what to do. 
                                 Naive ideal:   Natural language instructions. 
           Prepackaged solutions (apps)  are great when what they do is what you want. 
Programming enables you to make a computer do anything  you want.

Programming: telling a computer what to do 
Why program ? 
•Is a natural, satisfying and creative experience. 
•Enables accomplishments not otherwise possible. 
•The path to a new world of intellectual endeavor. 
5“ Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a 
  computer  what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining 
  to human  beings what we want a computer to do. ” 
− Donald Knuth 
Challenges 
•Need to learn what computers can do. 
•Need to learn a programming language .

Natural language 
•Easy for human. 
•Ambiguous and hard for computer

•Easy for computer. 
•Error-prone for human. High-level language 
•Some difficulty for both. 
•An acceptable tradeoff. 
But which  high-level language? 
Naive ideal:  A single programming language for all purposes.

7Our Choice: Python 
Python features 
•Widely used/available. 
•Under development since early/mid 1990s. 
•Embraces modern abstractions. 
•Several widely used libraries (e.g. pandas/scikit-learn) 
Facts of life 
•No language is perfect. 
•You need to start with some  language. 
Our approach 
•Use a minimal subset of Python. 
•Develop general programming skills that are applicable to many languages. 
It’s not about the language! “ There are only two kinds of 
programming languages: those 
people always [gripe] about and 
those nobody uses. ”

Programming in Python: Summary 
NB – python3/python is used 
interchangeably in text 


Coding, Compiling and Running 
Code  refers to program text, while coding refers to the act of creating and editing the code. 
A compiler translates a program from the Python language to a language the computer understands 
(converts a .py file to a .pyc file). It compiles  the Python program. The python compiler  compiles your 
program. 
Executing (or running)  is when you transfer control of your computer from system to your program. The 
python interpreter  directs your computer to follow your instructions. 


Errors 
Compile-time errors: caught when the the program is compiled, i.e. a syntax error. 
Run-time errors: logical errors in your program which only show up once you execute it. 
Errors are also referred to as  bugs .


Syntax is important 
A) small “s” B) Colons are 
important 
No semi-colons 
after statements C) indentation 
D) underscore A)File "helloworld.py", line 1, in <module>

Algorithmic Thinking 


Algorithm 
Algorithm:  a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by 
a computer. 
Example 
Develop an algorithm to pick the largest number from the following list 
1, 7, 9, 3, 5, 6 
1. Choose first number and assign to it the label of 
current number 
2. Compare the remaining numbers with the current number in 
the order given in the list. 
3. If a larger number is found make it the current number and then continue 
comparing as before (continue where you are in the list). 
4. Continue in this way until you have run through all the numbers in the list. 
5. The number labelled as current number will be the largest number in the list. 

Exercise: Puzzle 
Develop an algorithm which can be used to complete a jigsaw puzzle. You may assume the puzzle has no 
missing pieces. You may assume that you can clearly identify the top, left, bottom and right hand side of each 
piece. 


Exercise: Puzzle 
Develop an algorithm which can be used to complete a jigsaw puzzle. You may assume the puzzle 
has no missing pieces. You may assume that you can clearly identify the top, left, bottom and right 
hand side of each piece. 
1. Put first piece down or choose a random piece which is already connected to 
the puzzle and still has unconnected sides. We will call this piece the focus piece. 
If there are no such pieces the puzzle is complete. 
2. Pick the first unconnected side along a clockwise direction (start at its left side) 
of the focus piece and label it side 1. If there are no more unconnected sides go 
to step 1. 
3. Pick up a random unconnected puzzle piece (discarding pieces you have tried 
before in conjunction with the current focus piece) and label it temporary piece. 
4. Pick the first open side along a clockwise direction (start at its left side) 
of the temporary piece discarding sides that you have already tried (with the 
current focus-temporary pair) and label it side 2. If you have tried all sides 
put the piece down and go to step 3. 
5. Compare side 1 and side 2. If they fit go to step 2 else go to step 4.

Built-in data types 
A data type  is a set of values and a set of operations on those values. 
35type set of values sample literals operations 
str sequences of characters 'Hello World' 
"CS isn't fun" +
int integers 17
12345 +  -  *  //  %  ** 
float floating-point numbers 3.1415 
6.022e23 +  -  *  //  %  ** 
bool truth values True 
False and, or, not 
Python's built-in data types 

36Pop quiz on data types 
Q. What is a data type? 

37Pop quiz on data types 
Q. What is a data type? 
A. A set of values and a set of operations on those values. 

38Basic Definitions 
Variable is a name that refers to a data-type value. 
Identifiers  is a Python-code representation of a name. 
Literal  is a programming-language representation of a data-type value. 
Assignment statement  using the = operator associates a data-type value with a variable. 
Expression  is a combination of literals, variables, and operators that Python evaluates to produce a value. 
The meaning of = in a program is NOT the same as in a mathematical equation. 


39Objects 
●Object .  An object is an in-computer-memory representation of a value from a particular data 
type. 
●Identity . Uniquely identifies an object (memory address) 
●Type . The set of values it might represent and the set of operations that can be performed 
on it. 
●Value . The data-type value that it represents 
●Object reference . An object reference is nothing more than a concrete representation of the 
object’s identity (memory address). 


40Expressions 
Operators  specify data type operations on one or more operand. 
Operand  can be any expression. 
Binary  operators  take two expressions. 
Precedence  multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. 
Left-associativity a-b-c same as (a-b)-c. All operators except exponentiation. 
Right-associativity  a**b**c same as a**(b**c). 
Parenthesis  overrides precedence rules. 


41Exercise: Definitions 
Fill in the missing labels: 
a = 0 
c = a+1 
c = c + b 
c = (2*c)+4 
C = 2 + d 
A
B
C
D
E

42Answer 
Fill in the missing labels: 
A → Assignment 
B → Literal/Operand 
C → Variable/Operand 
D → Expression 
E → Operator 
   


43Object Trace 
Program behavior is typically understood using traces .
Informal trace  table showing values after each line of the program. 
Object trace shows variables, object references, and objects for each line of the 
program.  An object trace example is below. 


44Basic Conversions 
str-to-int 
int(“123”)  
int(sys.argv[1]) 
int-to-str 
a = “123” 
b = 99 
c = int(a) + b 
stdio.writeln(a+” + “+str(b)+” = ”+str(c)) 
123 + 99 = 222

46Data type for computing with strings: str (will use str and string) 
values sequences of characters 
typical literals 'Hello, '   '1 '   ' * ' 
operation concatenate 
operator +
escape sequence '\t', '\n', '\\', and '\'' str data type 
expression value 
'Hi, ' + 'Bob' 'Hi, Bob' 
'1' + ' 2 ' + '1' '1 2 1' 
'1234' + ' + ' + '99' '1234 + 99' 
'1234' + '99' '123499' 
Typical use: Input and output. Examples of String  operations (concatenation) Important note: 
Character interpretation depends on context! 
'1234' + ' + ' + '99' Ex 1: plus signs 
'1234' + ' + ' + '99' Ex 2: spaces character 
operator operator 
white space white space 
space characters 

Example of computing with strings: subdivisions of a ruler

ruler1 = '1' 
ruler2 = ruler1 + ' 2 ' + ruler1 
ruler3 = ruler2 + ' 3 ' + ruler2 
ruler4 = ruler3 + ' 4 ' + ruler3

65Comparisons 
Comparisons.  Take two operands of one type (e.g., int) and produce a result of type bool . Lower 
precedence than arithmetic operators, higher than boolean operators. 


66Leap Year 
Q.  Is a given year a leap year? 
A.  Yes if either (i) divisible by 400 or (ii) divisible by 4 but not 100. 


67Example: Leap Year 
((1900%4  == 0) && (1900 % 100 != 0)) || (1900 % 400 == 0) 
=> ((0  == 0) && (0 != 0)) || (300 == 0) 
=> (true && false) || false 
=> false 
% python3 leapyear.py 1900 
false 


68Exercise: Leap Year

COMPLETE…. 
% python3 leapyear.py 2000 
true 


69Answer 
((2000%4  == 0) && (2000 % 100 != 0)) || (2000 % 400 == 0) 
=> ((0  == 0) && (0 != 0)) || (0 == 0) 
=> (true && false) || true
