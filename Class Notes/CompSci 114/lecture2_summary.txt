### Introduction to Programming in Python: Conditionals & Loops

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Control Flow**:
   - Determines the sequence of statements executed in a program.
   - Managed through **conditionals** (like `if` statements) and **loops** (like `while` and `for` loops).

2. **Conditionals**:
   - **If Statement**: Executes a block of code if a condition is true. 
     ```python
     if (condition):
         # code to execute if condition is true
     else:
         # code to execute if condition is false
     ```
   - **Example**: Sorting two numbers.
     ```python
     if (b < a):
         t = a
         a = b
         b = t
     ```

3. **Loops**:
   - **While Loop**: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.
     ```python
     while (condition):
         # code to execute
     ```
   - **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence or range.
     ```python
     for <variable> in range(<start>, <end>):
         # code to execute
     ```
   - **Do-While Loop**: Executes code at least once and checks condition after.
     ```python
     while True:
         # code to execute
         if (condition):
             break
     ```

4. **Nesting**:
   - Conditionals and loops can be nested inside each other for more complex control flows.
     ```python
     if (condition1):
         if (condition2):
             # nested code
     ```

5. **Debugging**:
   - A vital part of programming involves finding and fixing errors in code.
   - Types of errors:
     - **Syntax Errors**: Mistakes in code formatting.
     - **Runtime Errors**: Errors occurring during program execution.
     - **Logic Errors**: Code runs but does not produce the correct result.

**Practical Examples**:
- **Coin Flip**: 
   ```python
   import stdrandom
   def main():
       if stdrandom.uniform() < 0.5:
           stdio.writeln('Heads')
       else:
           stdio.writeln('Tails')
   ```

- **Powers of Two**:
   ```python
   def main():
       n = int(sys.argv[1])
       i = 0
       v = 1
       while (i <= n):
           stdio.writeln(v)
           i += 1
           v *= 2
   ```

- **Nesting Example**:
   ```python
   for i in range(5):
       for j in range(3):
           stdio.writeln(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
   ```

**Good Practices**:
- Use conditionals to handle potential runtime errors.
- Test programs with various inputs to ensure functionality.
- Comment code to clarify intent and structure.

### Summary
Understanding conditionals and loops is essential for controlling the flow of a program in Python. These constructs allow programmers to implement logical decisions and repetitive tasks effectively while debugging skills are crucial for successful programming.
